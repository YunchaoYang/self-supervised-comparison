# Self-Supervised Learning for Computer Vision

This repository implements and compares various self-supervised learning methods for computer vision tasks. We explore popular methods like MoCo, SimCLR, BYOL, SWAV, and SimSiam, and conduct experiments to understand their performance on different datasets.

## Introduction
Self-supervised learning is an emerging area in deep learning where models are trained without the need for labeled data. Instead, models are trained using pretext tasks that involve generating labels from the input data. In this repository, we explore and compare several popular self-supervised learning methods to understand their strengths and weaknesses.

## Implemented Methods
The following self-supervised learning methods are implemented in this repository:

- MoCo (Momentum Contrast)
- SimCLR (Simple Contrastive Learning)
- BYOL (Bootstrap Your Own Latent)
- SWAV (Swapping Assignments between Views)
- SimSiam (Simplified Siamese)

## Requirements


##
Setup
Clone the repository:

```bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/self-supervised-learning.git
cd self-supervised-learning
Install the required packages:
```

Copy code
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Data
Before running the experiments, you will need to download the dataset(s) used in the experiments. [Provide details on how to download and preprocess the dataset(s) if necessary.]

## Training
To train the models using a specific self-supervised learning method, use the following command:

```bash
python train.py --method moco
```
Replace moco with the desired method (simclr, byol, swav, or simsiam).

## Evaluation
To evaluate the trained models on downstream tasks, use the following command:

```bash
python evaluate.py --method moco --pretrained path_to_moco_model_checkpoint
```
